## Introduction

This is a Node.js starter template with TypeScript to easily get started on a production ready app. Included are:

- Express: most popular framework for Node.js.
- Nodemon: to automatically update and refresh the server when you make changes.
- ESlint + Prettier + Husky Git Hooks: to format the code and ensure that no matter who works on the code, it will stay formatted the same way.

## Project Setup

- To run the app, run `yarn install` and `yarn dev`.
- The lint and function is `yarn lint`.
- The lint function will auto-run when you try to commit to a git repo along with prettier to auto-format the code, set up in the .husky folder.

Note: This app was designed to only be used with yarn to prevent a `package-lock.json` from being created which can cause conflicts - change the `engines` in `package.json` if you want to use npm instead.
